# Day-Planner

This application functions by displaying the current date in the header. The planner saves the user input to local storage and renders the saved input into the planner on reload. The planner also displays future hours in the day with a green background, the current hour with a red background, and past hours with a gray background. This application uses Jquery and dayjs to fulfill the app's functions.
